# Monaco Markdown 

This is a port of [Markdown extension for VS Code](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown)
 for [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor) web editor.
 
 The initial plugin is based on the VS Code API, while this one uses only Monaco editor API. The logic
 and the functionality is pretty much the same.
